# Web Scraping Law Data

**NOTE**: Unfortunately, the code for this project is proprietary and cannot be shared publically. If you want to learn more about this project, feel free to reach out to me. 

This is a purely backend-centric project for collecting state-wide legal data for consumer use, primarily being used in [these mobile apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/colorado-law-codes/id1622729259). Some of the key technologies being used in this case are the following:
* `Python`, `Swift`, and `Kotlin`
* `Pandas` and `Selenium`
* `Postgres`, `SQLite`, and `Realm`
* `FastAPI` and `Flask`
* `Scrapy`
* `Docker` and `AWS`

A series of microservices and web scraping applications have been developed in order to handle the vast legal information across 8 U.S. states (currently expanding). This includes monitoring law modifications, processing law data for efficient storage, and tracking user subscription data.

# What the Future Holds
Although the proprietary code for this cannot be shared, a more public-friendly API for querying state laws is currently in the works and will be shared once complete!

I am continually expanding the backend to improve the apps I provide. The apps collectively have an impressive 94% retention rate, and is the culmination of nearly 6+ years of individual work. I hope to continue to help legal professionals in their careers by expanding these services in the near and long-term.
